This is my first attempt of outfit mod. Still working in progress. Not ready to deploy to PAZ folder yet.

It is a mod to Grandpa's Cron Helper outfit of Maegu.

Here's the current folder structure:

- [original](original) : source files of the mod.
- [modified](modified) : the, still experimental, mods.
  - [modified/no-upper](modified/no-upper): hide upper completely.
  - [modified/test](modified/test): a more revealing version of the original outfit manually edited with Blender.
