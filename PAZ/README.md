# Overview

BDO NSFW mod generated by Midnight Xyzw. The project's main page is on GitHub: https://github.com/midnightxyzw/bdo-nsfw

# What's included

## 1. [No Underwear](files_to_patch/_player/_00_remove_underwear)
This mod hides underwear for all classes (except Shai), up to Scholar. It does not contain any nude texture/mesh in it, to make it easier to use it with your own version of nude mod.

## 2. [Suzu's Nude Mod](files_to_patch/_player/_00_suzu_nude)
This is nude model and skin for all female classes (except Shai), up to Scholar, originally created by fantastic [Suzu](https://www.undertow.club/downloads/authors/suzu-%E9%88%B4.26775/).

This folder, with `No Underwear` together, provides the basis of the entire MOD.

## 3. [All Armor Removed](files_to_patch/_player/_00_remove_all_armors)

This mod hides all armors for all classes (except Shai), up to Scholar.

There's currently no options like the resorpless mod used to have. Adding those options involves non-trivial work that I'm not sure when I have enough bandwidth to take. So don't ask.

# How to use it

1. Make sure your game is not patched in any way. Applying this mod on an already patched game is not tested.
2. Copy everything in this folder and sub folders to your game's PAZ folder.
3. From the game's PAZ folder, do the following to patch the game:
   1. Run [midnight_xyzw.cmd](midnight_xyzw.cmd) and follow screen instructions to customize the mod.
   2. Run [PartCutGen.exe](PartCutGen.exe) and follow screen instructions to refresh the part cut exclusion list.
   3. Run [Meta Injector.exe](<Meta Injector.exe>) and follow screen instructions to patch your game.
4. Have Fun!

# Work In Progress

- Verified against 06/26/2024 official patch on NA server.
- What's New:
  - Added 2 independent switches to control which subset of armors to hide:
    - switch #1: Female VS. male
    - switch #2: Free VS. Pearl Items.
    - So total 4 sub categories you can choose from.
- Know Issues:
  - Pearl outfits seperation works mostly fine, with a few exceptions. I found that the following pearl outfits are somehow categoriezed as free items: Bern, Blanchard, Binari. There might be more.
