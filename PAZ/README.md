# Overview

BDO NSFW mod collected/generated by Midnight Xyzw. The project's main page is on GitHub: https://github.com/midnightxyzw/bdo-nsfw

# What's included

## 1. [No Underwear](files_to_patch/_player/_00_remove_underwear)
This mod hides underwear for all classes (except Shai), up to Scholar. It does not contain any nude texture/mesh in it, to make it easier to use it with your own version of nude mod.

## 2. [Suzu's Nude Mod](files_to_patch/_player/_00_suzu_nude)
This is nude model and skin for all female classes (except Shai), up to Scholar, originally created by [Suzu](https://www.undertow.club/downloads/authors/suzu-%E9%88%B4.26775/).

This mod, with `No Underwear` together, provides the foundation of NSFW mod for BDO.

## 3. [All Armor Removed](files_to_patch/_player/_00_remove_all_armors)

This mod hides all armors for all classes (except Shai), up to Scholar.

Note that this one could easily conflict with other individual armor mods. If you encounter issues when using this with your own armor mod and/or simply don't like it, just delete the entire folder, then re-apply the mod to game.

# How to use it

1. Make sure your game is not patched in any way. Applying this mod on an already patched game is not tested.
2. Copy everything in this folder and sub folders to your game's PAZ folder.
3. Run [PartCutGen.exe](PartCutGen.exe) and follow screen instructions to refresh the part cut exclusion list.
4. Run [Meta Injector.exe](<Meta Injector.exe>) and follow screen instructions to patch your game.
5. Have Fun!
