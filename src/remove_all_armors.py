This folder contains patch files to hide all armors, except boots, from all player classes up to release of Scholar.

- Put it under files_to_patch folder.
- Run PartCutGen.exe to refresh your partcuts_desc.xml
- Run Meta Injector.exe to patch your game.

# Release Notes

- No nude mesh/skin contained here. It is intended to be used with your own
  collection of nude mods and armor patches.

- Generated by Midnight Xyzw's BDO NSFW patch.
